# üè• Hospital Data Management System

## Overview

This project provides a centralized, scalable, and relational database system to manage hospital operations such as staff scheduling, patient care, appointments, treatments, room assignments, billing, and payments. The solution is designed for deployment on **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** and is structured for seamless integration with BI tools and future EMR systems.

## üìå Problem Statement

The hospital currently lacks a unified system for tracking operational and clinical data. Information silos, manual processes, and fragmented billing are leading to inefficiencies and risks in patient care. This project solves that by introducing a normalized database system that ensures data integrity, real-time access, and cross-departmental visibility.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Design a robust, normalized relational schema for hospital management.
- Support scheduling, treatment records, and financial transactions.
- Ensure referential integrity and query performance.
- Provide a future-proof foundation for analytics and third-party system integration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Scope

### 1. Patient Management
- Store patient demographic and contact data.
- Track admissions, discharges, and transfers.

### 2. Doctor & Staff Management
- Maintain records for staff with roles and specializations.
- Schedule shifts and manage staff allocations.

### 3. Appointments & Scheduling
- Manage doctor-patient appointment workflows.
- Avoid booking conflicts and enforce availability.

### 4. Diagnosis & Treatment
- Store test results, diagnoses, medications, and procedures.
- Link treatments to invoices and room admissions.

### 5. Billing & Payments
- Generate and track invoices for treatments and tests.
- Record payments, payment methods, and tax calculations.

## üß± Database Schema Highlights

The schema is implemented under a dedicated PostgreSQL schema: `ChironaSchema`.

### Key Tables:
- `Staff`, `Doctor`, `AdminStaff`
- `Patient`, `Appointment`, `MedicalTest`, `Treatment`, `Admission`
- `Invoice`, `TreatmentInvoice`, `MedicalTestInvoice`, `Payment`
- `Room`, `Shift`, `ShiftAssignment`

All constraints are enforced through:
- Foreign keys
- Check constraints
- Default values

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Deployment Instructions

1. **Provision Azure PostgreSQL**
   - Use Azure Portal to create a PostgreSQL flexible server.
   - Enable SSL and set firewall rules to allow your IP.

2. **Upload Credentials**
   - Create `conn.yml` with the following format:
     ```yaml
     dbname: your_db_name
     admin: your_username
     passwd: your_password
     server: your_server_name.postgres.database.azure.com
     port: 5432
     ```

3. **Run the Python Script**
   ```bash
   python script.py
